issues ~ models and ORM:

Creating the Django Project:
Difficulty in initiating the new project called "MyProjectManagement" and the subapp "projects_tool."

Registering the Subapp:
Required guidance on how to properly register the "projects_tool" subapp within the Django project settings after creation.

Defining Models:
Challenges in defining the required models for projects, boards, lists, tasks, and labels in projects_tool/models.py.

Implementing Unique Constraints:
Issues with ensuring that fields like project titles and board titles were unique and not blank or null, which is crucial for the database integrity.

Setting Field Constraints:
Difficulties in implementing various constraints for fields, such as maximum character limits and nullability requirements.

ForeignKey Relationships:
Challenges in defining ForeignKey relationships between models (e.g., between projects and boards, boards and lists) to maintain proper relational integrity.

Deleting Associated Data:
Needed to set up the deletion behavior for models (e.g., ensuring that deleting a project also removes its associated boards, lists, tasks, and labels).

Generating and Applying Migrations:
Required assistance in generating migrations using python3 manage.py makemigrations and applying them with python3 manage.py migrate, and understanding the process if issues arose.

Handling Migration Errors:
Encountered errors during migrations that needed to be resolved before proceeding, especially related to model definitions and constraints.

Testing Models in the Django Shell:
Wanted to test the model implementations in the Django shell, ensuring they functioned as expected, including creating instances and checking validations.

Manual Data Entry in DBeaver:
Sought guidance on how to manually add entries to the database using DBeaver and validate those entries through the Django shell.

Ensuring Correct Database Setup:
Need to verify that the database tables and columns reflected the expected structure according to your model definitions after applying migrations.
